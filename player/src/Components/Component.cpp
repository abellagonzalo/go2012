/*
 * Name: Component.cpp
 * @Author: Carlos AgÃ¼ero (caguero@gsyc.es)
 *
 * Description: Abstract class that defines some data structures and methods contained
 * in every component. It has an abstract method step() that should implement each
 * specific component.
 *
 * All components work in the same way and defines how BICA architecture operates. A
 * component is executed in a iterative way calling its step() method. In order to not
 * overhead the system, a call to step() could be ignored by the component itself. Every
 * component should specify a minimum amount of time between several step() calls. If
 * the elapsed time between the last real step() and the current time is not enough,
 * the call will be ignored.
 *
 * Another important feature is that components are designed as singletons. So, there is
 * only one instance of every component present in the system. In order to use the behavior
 * of a component, a client should declare a pointer to the component and calls to
 * getInstance() method to initialize it. After that, the client can use the component as
 * it has been created with the usual new().
 *
 * The component has also some debug utilities to calculate the cycle time consumption,
 * the real frequency operation, etc.
 *
 * The common use of a component is for getting some information (position of the ball,
 * position of the blueNet, etc.) or for unleash some behavior (turn left the head, walk
 * straight, ...). In order to get information a client should call step() and the ask for
 * the information. In order to unleash some behavior a client should modulate the component
 * with some of its method and then call step().
