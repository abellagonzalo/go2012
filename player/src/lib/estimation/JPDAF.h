 * @Author: Carlos Ag√ºero (caguero@gsyc.es)
 *
 * Description: Class that implements a probabilistic multi-object estimator. The
 * code is mainly based on the paper "People Tracking with a Mobile Robot Using
 * Sample-based Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filters" written by Dirk Schulz
 * et all. This class uses a fixed set of Kalman Filters (as an alternative to the work
 * shown in the paper, in which uses particle filters) and a probabilistic algorithm
 * for associate observations and objects.
